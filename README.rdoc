= Unfuzzle

== Description

The Unfuzzle gem provides an interface to the Unfuddle JSON API

== Installation

    sudo gem install vigetlabs-unfuzzle --source=http://gems.github.com

== Usage

To get started, you'll need your Unfuddle subdomain and a valid username / 
password combination:

    require 'unfuzzle'
    
    Unfuzzle.subdomain = 'viget'
    Unfuzzle.username  = 'bopbip'
    Unfuzzle.password  = 'bleep'
    
Once that is configured, you can start accessing data from the API.

=== Projects

Pulling back a list of projects is simple.  Based on the currently logged-in
user, you can see which ones he has access to:

    projects = Unfuzzle::Project.all # => [#<Unfuzzle::Project:0x11e9280 ...> , ...]
    project = projects.first
    
There are a few attributes available for a project:

    project.id                              # => 123
    project.slug                            # => "salty"
    project.name                            # => "Salty Co."
    project.archived?                       # => false
    project.created_at.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') # => "2008-07-28"
    
To see a list of additional attributes, take a look at the documentation for
Unfuzzle::Project.
